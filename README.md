- CPT-invarant symemetry through "anti-symmetry" of universe. (signs doesnt exists?)

- might explains dark matter production

- ANITA ( Antarctic Impulsive Transient Antenna )

- interesitng so if "cross" with big bounce loop. there is another one that loop that goes another direction

- mystery of mass of a neutrino(Neutrinos have a small, nonzero mass, which has been constrained by various experiments but not yet precisely determined.) 

postulate to be fixed, up to some statistical distribution, 

(even each neutrino or particle known has a different mass as you observed them "all the time" due to uncertainty principal) <--- quantum statistical fluctuation 

Centrla limiting theorem vs thermal fluctuation 

(gotta leave room for marginal error for the theory? or the mass?)

- "dont quote me"

- Friedmann–Robertson–Walker (FRW) metric

Philsophical Implicaiton:

We are internally biased but we can see the bigger picture. Smooth talk.
