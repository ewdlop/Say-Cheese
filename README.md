- CPT-invariant symmetry through "anti-symmetry" of the universe. (signs don't exist?)

- might explain dark matter production

- ANITA ( Antarctic Impulsive Transient Antenna )

- interesting so if "cross" with a big bounce "loop". there is another loop that goes the possible only one other direction

- mystery of mass of a neutrino(Neutrinos have a small, nonzero mass, which has been constrained by various experiments but not yet precisely determined) 

postulate to be fixed, up to some statistical distribution, 

(even each neutrino or particle known has a different mass as you observed them "all the time" due to the uncertainty principle) <--- quantum statistical fluctuation 

Central limiting theorem vs thermal fluctuation 

(gotta leave room for marginal error for the theory? or the mass?)

- "don't quote me"

- Friedmann–Robertson–Walker (FRW) metric

Philosophical Implication:

We are internally biased but we can see the bigger picture—smooth talk.
